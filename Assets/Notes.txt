two button mobile game - left and right
you control a little white box that has cool particle trail
you get upgrades and various things that make you stronger
you fly down the screen and avoid spinning blocks, enemies, etc
the game is technically and endless runner, but there are checkpoints in the middle
you can replay earlier sections to improve your power at that point, or continue from where you left off
	the point potential increases per level, e.g.: 10, 20, 40, 80, … 
	so you don’t have to replay level 1 over and over
	your score is measured as a % of possible points?
	or grade/starts - 90% is considered perfect (you get all upgrade points)
when you start a level, you can spend all your upgrade points on various things?

something like 100 levels, or maybe 3-5 games with 30 levels each
the background starts as just black (or just green, blue, etc in other modes)
the background gets progressively cooler and crazier stuff happens
possible worlds
	black - normal - longest and most varied, possibly bosses and things like that
	green - adventure
	blue - pacifism or slow
	red - speed or shooting

	different worlds could have different steering styles - drifting, car steering, no going straight

development:
core gameplay is extremely simple
once that’s done, continually add new sections to the game

between rounds all your upgrades get pulled off and converted back to money
when you start a new level you can spend all the money you have

Upgrades
	speed
	shield bubble - can’t have multiple, but can upgrade recharge time
	slow motion when in danger / when take a damage
	repel bullets
	suck in gold
	double tap to dash
	hold both buttons for .25 to slow down
	extra lives for level

2 player mode!
	coop campaign
	vs mode where you shoot semi-random bullet patterns at each other
		you get to choose your taunt phrase (Now you will see my TRUE form!)

===============================

boss focused?
bosses are “benevolent”, they do this for YOUR good/training
they have different difficulty levels, later levels unlock different forms
3 dancing guys
	constantly tell you to dance
	music lines up with their attacks
	charged laser beams
	synced up waves of bullets
spooky long haired girl
	10 miles of hair, finally get to the top and she turns around
	one eye is covered, maybe gets revealed as super scary powerful eye
	uses minions/spirits that she summons while her back is turned
rolling/bouncing robot
	intro level boss
	opens his wings and lasers/guns come out on robot arms
the moon
	shadow of the moon spins around
	shoots bullets and lasers from a million miles away
	summons lots of mysterious minions

endless-ness:
start in blackness, rise above the ground where you see mountains/spooky girl start
rise up to the  moon
the world slowly rotates 180 and you travel back to the ground
you burst through the ground and enter mysterious land again

==============================

slice:

basic enemies
	idle
	spinning long boxes
	angled path, shooting
	pause, fly towards player
complex enemies
	big enemy with basic bullet pattern
	big enemy with spinning lasers
boss
	complex bullet patterns
	scripted movement/shooting pattern

bullet waves - tweening, scripting
	gun system

respawn system, lives

level structure
placement of enemies, activating events
	event box that turns on children
	maybe box under the player that enables things that enter it?
restarting

backgrounds
	efficient scrolling background - start, loop, end sections

==============================

simpler upgrade scheme
getting x stars on a previous level gives you a bonus upgrade
	Or getting x TOTAL stars
can allocate a small number of upgrades before starting a level (rather than gold)
will remember your allocation between rounds, but can switch at any time
screen shows you flying, has tick-able boxes around you
	box above represents shield
	line of boxes for extra lives, etc
