design:

two button mobile game - left and right
you control a little white box that has cool particle trail

the game flows like an endless runner, but there are checkpoints in the middle
you can replay earlier sections to gain stars, or continue from where you left off
getting x stars on a previous level gives you a bonus upgrade
	or getting x TOTAL stars
	provides multiple challenges - 3 starring earlier levels vs beating hard ones
can allocate a small number of upgrades before starting a level
	will remember your allocation between rounds, but can switch at any time
	screen shows you flying, has tick-able boxes around you
		box above represents shield
		line of boxes for extra lives, etc

upgrades
	speed
	shield bubble - can’t have multiple, but can upgrade recharge time
	slow motion when in danger / when take a damage
	repel bullets
	suck in gold
	double tap to dash
	hold both buttons for .25 to slow down
	extra lives for level

2 player mode!
	coop campaign
	vs mode where you shoot semi-random bullet patterns at each other
		you get to choose your taunt phrase (Now you will see my TRUE form!)

=====================================================================================

world:

the background starts as just black (or just green, blue, etc in other modes)
the background gets progressively cooler and crazier stuff happens

possibly multiple worlds
	black - normal - longest and most varied
	green - adventure
	blue - pacifism or slow
	red - speed or shooting

	different worlds could have different steering styles
		drifting, car steering, no going straight

=====================================================================================

levels:

boss focused?
bosses are “benevolent”, they do this for YOUR good/training
they have different difficulty levels, later levels unlock different forms
3 dancing guys
	constantly tell you to dance
	music lines up with their attacks
	charged laser beams
	synced up waves of bullets
spooky long haired girl
	10 miles of hair, finally get to the top and she turns around
	one eye is covered, maybe gets revealed as super scary powerful eye
	uses minions/spirits that she summons while her back is turned
rolling/bouncing robot
	intro level boss
	opens his wings and lasers/guns come out on robot arms
the moon
	shadow of the moon spins around
	shoots bullets and lasers from a million miles away
	summons lots of mysterious minions

endless-ness
	start in blackness
	rise above the ground where you see mountains/spooky girl start
	rise up to the  moon
	the world slowly rotates 180 and you speed back to the ground
		excuse is “just in time for supper” or similar
	you burst through the ground in slow motion and enter mysterious land again
	enable hard mode

instead of lots of levels, you play the same ones 3 times - standard, hard, insane

=====================================================================================

= basic enemies
	angled path, shooting
	pause, fly towards player
complex enemies
	big enemy with basic bullet pattern

=====================================================================================
