two button mobile game - left and right
you control a little white box that has cool particle trail
you get upgrades and various things that make you stronger
you fly down the screen and avoid spinning blocks, enemies, etc
the game is technically and endless runner, but there are checkpoints in the middle
you can replay earlier sections to improve your power at that point, or continue from where you left off
	the point potential increases per level, e.g.: 10, 20, 40, 80, … 
	so you don’t have to replay level 1 over and over
	your score is measured as a % of possible points?
	or grade/starts - 90% is considered perfect (you get all upgrade points)
when you start a level, you can spend all your upgrade points on various things?

something like 100 levels, or maybe 3-5 games with 30 levels each
the background starts as just black (or just green, blue, etc in other modes)
the background gets progressively cooler and crazier stuff happens
possible worlds
	black - normal - longest and most varied, possibly bosses and things like that
	green - adventure
	blue - pacifism or slow
	red - speed or shooting

	different worlds could have different steering styles - drifting, car steering, no going straight

development:
core gameplay is extremely simple
once that’s done, continually add new sections to the game

Between rounds all your upgrades get pulled off and converted back to money
When you start a new level you can spend all the money you have

Upgrades
	speed
	shield bubble - can’t have multiple, but can upgrade recharge time
	slow motion when in danger / when take a damage
	repel bullets
	suck in gold
	double tap to dash
	hold both buttons for .25 to slow down

2 player mode!
	coop campaign
	vs mode where you shoot semi-random bullet patterns at each other
		you get to choose your taunt phrase (Now you will see my TRUE form!)

===============================

boss focused?
bosses are “benevolent”, they do this for YOUR good/training
they have different difficulty levels, later levels unlock different forms
3 dancing guys
	constantly tell you to dance
	music lines up with their attacks
